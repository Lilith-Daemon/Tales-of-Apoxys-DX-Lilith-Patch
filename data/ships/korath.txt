	description "The Apoxys is a large warship of unknown origin, quite weak by most standards, but with the curious ability to grow and evolve as it experiences the galaxy. The ship is helmed not only by a human crew, but a powerful AI, known only as Maribelle; it's believed that, at one point, the Apoxys was a completely autonomous war machine, but for one reason or another, it has since been turned into a human-crewed vessel."
